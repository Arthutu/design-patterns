# Strategy Pattern üéØ

Welcome to the Strategy section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Strategy design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Strategy Pattern? ü§î

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it, promoting loose coupling and enabling runtime selection of algorithms. This pattern is useful when you need to define multiple algorithms and switch between them dynamically at runtime.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often scenarios where you need to implement multiple algorithms that perform the same task but differ in their implementation. However, directly embedding the algorithms into client code or using conditional logic to select the appropriate algorithm can lead to code duplication, tight coupling, and difficulty in maintaining and extending the code. Additionally, changes to the algorithms may require modifications to multiple classes.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Strategy Pattern solves this problem by encapsulating each algorithm into separate strategy objects and allowing the client to select the appropriate strategy dynamically. It defines a common interface for all strategies, enabling them to be used interchangeably. This promotes loose coupling between the client and the strategies, improves code organization, and makes it easier to add new strategies or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the code.

## When to Use the Strategy Pattern

Consider using the Strategy Pattern in the following situations:

- When you need to define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.
- When you want to encapsulate each algorithm into separate objects and allow the client to select the appropriate one dynamically.
- When you want to avoid using conditional logic or switch statements to select the algorithm, leading to code duplication and tight coupling.

## Structure of the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the execution of the algorithm to the strategy.
2. **Strategy**: Defines an interface for all supported algorithms.
3. **ConcreteStrategy**: Implements the algorithm defined by the Strategy interface.

## Example Code üßë‚Äçüíª
