# State Pattern üö¶

Welcome to the State section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the State design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the State Pattern? ü§î

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates the behavior of an object into separate state objects and delegates the behavior to the current state object. This pattern is useful when the behavior of an object depends on its state and changes dynamically at runtime.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often scenarios where an object's behavior changes depending on its internal state. However, directly implementing conditional logic to handle each state can lead to code duplication, tight coupling, and difficulty in maintaining and extending the code. Additionally, changes to the behavior of the object may require modifications to multiple classes.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The State Pattern solves this problem by defining separate state objects that encapsulate the behavior of an object for each state. It allows the object to delegate its behavior to the current state object, enabling the behavior to change dynamically as the internal state of the object changes. This promotes loose coupling, improves code organization, and makes it easier to add new states or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the code.

## When to Use the State Pattern

Consider using the State Pattern in the following situations:

- When an object's behavior depends on its internal state and changes dynamically at runtime.
- When you want to encapsulate the behavior of an object for each state into separate classes.
- When you want to avoid using conditional logic to handle each state, leading to code duplication and tight coupling.

## Structure of the State Pattern

The State Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Context**: Defines the interface of interest to clients and maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.
2. **State**: Defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.
3. **ConcreteState**: Implements the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.

## Example Code üßë‚Äçüíª

This repository provides example implementations of the State Pattern in various programming languages, including:
