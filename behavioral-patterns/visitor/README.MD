# Visitor Pattern üö™

Welcome to the Visitor section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Visitor design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Visitor Pattern? ü§î

The Visitor Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing class hierarchies without modifying their structure. It achieves this by separating the algorithm from the object structure on which it operates. This pattern is useful when you have a complex object structure with multiple classes and want to perform operations that depend on the concrete classes of the objects.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often scenarios where you need to perform operations on objects of different classes within a class hierarchy. However, directly adding new operations to each class in the hierarchy can lead to code duplication, tight coupling, and difficulty in maintaining and extending the code. Additionally, changes to the object structure or the operations may require modifications to multiple classes.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Visitor Pattern solves this problem by defining a visitor interface with visit methods for each class in the hierarchy. Concrete visitor implementations provide specific operations for each class. Object structures define an accept method that allows visitors to visit and operate on the elements of the structure. This promotes loose coupling between the algorithms and the object structure, improves code organization, and makes it easier to add new operations or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the code.

## When to Use the Visitor Pattern

Consider using the Visitor Pattern in the following situations:

- When you have a complex object structure with multiple classes and want to perform operations that depend on the concrete classes of the objects.
- When you want to add new behaviors to existing class hierarchies without modifying their structure.
- When you want to separate the algorithm from the object structure to promote loose coupling and improve code organization.

## Structure of the Visitor Pattern

The Visitor Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Visitor**: Defines a visitor interface with visit methods for each class in the hierarchy.
2. **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements specific operations for each class in the hierarchy.
3. **Element**: Defines an interface for accepting visitors.
4. **ConcreteElement**: Implements the accept method to allow visitors to visit and operate on the element.
5. **ObjectStructure**: Maintains a collection of elements and provides a method for accepting visitors.
