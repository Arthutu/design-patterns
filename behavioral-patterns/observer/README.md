# Observer Pattern üîç

Welcome to the Observer section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Observer design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Observer Pattern? ü§î

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a subject or publisher notifies its observers or subscribers of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It allows for loosely coupled communication between objects, enabling a change in one object to automatically trigger updates in other dependent objects. This pattern is useful when you need to maintain consistency between related objects without coupling them tightly.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often scenarios where multiple objects need to be notified of changes in the state of another object. However, directly coupling the objects together can lead to tight dependencies and make the code difficult to maintain and extend. Additionally, managing the registration and deregistration of observers can be challenging and error-prone.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Observer Pattern solves this problem by defining a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a subject or publisher maintains a list of its observers or subscribers and notifies them of any state changes. It promotes loose coupling by allowing observers to subscribe and unsubscribe dynamically, without requiring changes to the subject. This allows for flexible communication between objects and enables changes in one object to automatically trigger updates in other dependent objects.

## When to Use the Observer Pattern

Consider using the Observer Pattern in the following situations:

- When you need to maintain consistency between related objects without coupling them tightly.
- When multiple objects need to be notified of changes in the state of another object.
- When you want to support dynamic registration and deregistration of observers.

## Structure of the Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Subject**: Maintains a list of its observers and provides methods for subscribing and unsubscribing observers.
2. **Observer**: Defines an interface for receiving update notifications from the subject.
3. **ConcreteSubject**: Implements the Subject interface and notifies its observers of any state changes.
4. **ConcreteObserver**: Implements the Observer interface and receives update notifications from the subject.
