# Template Method Pattern üìë

Welcome to the Template Method section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Template Method design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Template Method Pattern? ü§î

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It allows for code reusability by providing a template for an algorithm while allowing subclasses to customize certain steps. This pattern is useful when you have multiple algorithms that share common steps but differ in their implementation details.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often scenarios where you need to implement multiple algorithms that follow a similar structure but differ in some steps. However, directly embedding the algorithms into client code or duplicating code across multiple algorithms can lead to code duplication, tight coupling, and difficulty in maintaining and extending the code. Additionally, changes to the algorithm structure may require modifications to multiple classes.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Template Method Pattern solves this problem by defining a template method in the superclass that defines the skeleton of the algorithm with common steps. Subclasses can then override specific steps to provide custom implementations while reusing the common structure defined by the superclass. This promotes code reusability, improves code organization, and makes it easier to add new algorithms or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the code.

## When to Use the Template Method Pattern

Consider using the Template Method Pattern in the following situations:

- When you have multiple algorithms that follow a similar structure but differ in some steps.
- When you want to define a common algorithm structure in a superclass and allow subclasses to customize specific steps.
- When you want to avoid code duplication and tightly coupling algorithms with client code.

## Structure of the Template Method Pattern

The Template Method Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **AbstractClass**: Defines a template method that defines the algorithm structure with common steps and may include abstract methods that subclasses must override.
2. **ConcreteClass**: Implements the abstract methods defined by the AbstractClass to provide specific implementations for the customizable steps.

## Example Code üßë‚Äçüíª
