# Abstract Factory Pattern üè≠

Welcome to the Abstract Factory Pattern section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Abstract Factory design pattern along with code examples in python.

## What is the Abstract Factory Pattern? ü§î

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows a client to create objects without needing to know their specific implementations.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

Imagine a software application that needs to create GUI components, such as buttons and checkboxes, for different operating systems, such as Windows and MacOS. Each operating system requires a different set of GUI components with their own styles and behaviors. Without the Abstract Factory Pattern, the application might have complex conditional statements to determine the type of operating system and instantiate the corresponding GUI components.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Abstract Factory Pattern solves this problem by defining an abstract factory interface that declares methods for creating families of related objects, such as buttons and checkboxes. Concrete implementations of the abstract factory interface are provided for each supported operating system, each of which creates its own set of GUI components. The client code uses the abstract factory interface to create GUI components without needing to know the specific implementations for each operating system.

## When to Use the Abstract Factory Pattern? üí°

Consider using the Abstract Factory Pattern in the following situations:

- When a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
- When a system should be configured with one of multiple families of objects.
- When a family of related product objects is designed to be used together and ensuring that they are compatible.

## Structure of the Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Abstract Factory**: Declares an interface for creating a family of products.
2. **Concrete Factory**: Implements the Abstract Factory interface to create concrete product objects.
3. **Abstract Product**: Declares an interface for a type of product object.
4. **Concrete Product**: Implements the Abstract Product interface to define a product object.

## Example Code

This repository provides example implementations of the Abstract Factory Pattern in [python](./python_examply.py). Feel free to explore the code and experiment with it.
