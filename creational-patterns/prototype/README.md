# Prototype Pattern üß¨

Welcome to the Prototype section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Prototype design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Prototype Pattern? ü§î

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows the creation of objects based on a template or prototype instance. It involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, and then modifying them as needed. This pattern is useful when the construction of a new object is more efficient by copying an existing object rather than creating it from scratch.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

Imagine a software application that needs to create multiple instances of complex objects, such as documents, with similar content but differing in some details. Creating each object from scratch can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially if the objects share many common characteristics. Additionally, modifying an existing object to create a new one can lead to unintended side effects if not handled properly.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Prototype Pattern solves this problem by defining a prototype interface that allows objects to be copied or cloned. Concrete prototype implementations provide methods for cloning themselves, allowing new instances to be created based on existing objects. This allows for efficient creation of new objects by copying existing ones and then modifying only the necessary details.

## When to Use the Prototype Pattern

Consider using the Prototype Pattern in the following situations:

- When the instantiation of a new object is more efficient by copying an existing object rather than creating it from scratch.
- When objects need to be created dynamically at runtime based on varying requirements.
- When you want to avoid subclassing to create new objects with varying configurations.

## Structure of the Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Prototype**: Specifies an interface for cloning itself.
2. **Concrete Prototype**: Implements the Prototype interface to provide cloning functionality.
3. **Client**: Creates new objects by copying existing prototypes.

## Example Code üßë‚Äçüíª
