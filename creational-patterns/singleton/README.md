# Singleton Pattern üîí

Welcome to the Singleton section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Singleton design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Singleton Pattern? ü§î

The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are scenarios where only a single instance of a class should exist throughout the program execution. Common examples include managing resources, such as database connections, logging instances, or configuration settings. Without the Singleton pattern, multiple instances of such classes could be created, leading to inefficiencies or unexpected behavior.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Singleton Pattern addresses this problem by providing a way to ensure that a class has only one instance and providing a global point of access to that instance. It involves creating a class with a method that returns the same instance of the class every time it is called. Additionally, the Singleton class typically ensures that no other instance can be created by defining a private constructor and providing a static method to access the instance.

## When to Use the Singleton Pattern

Consider using the Singleton Pattern in the following situations:

- When you need to ensure that only one instance of a class exists throughout the program.
- When you need a global access point to that instance.

## Structure of the Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Singleton Class**: Defines a static method that returns the same instance of the class every time it is called. It also typically defines a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation of the class.
