# Facade Pattern üè¢

Welcome to the Facade section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Facade design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Facade Pattern? ü§î

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by hiding its complexities. This pattern is useful when you need to simplify a complex system or provide a simpler interface to a set of interfaces.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often scenarios where you need to interact with a complex subsystem consisting of multiple classes and interfaces. Managing the interactions and dependencies between these classes and interfaces directly can lead to complex and tightly coupled code. Additionally, clients may need to have detailed knowledge of the subsystem's internal structure, making the code harder to maintain.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Facade Pattern solves this problem by providing a simplified interface that hides the complexities of the subsystem from clients. It acts as a single entry point to the subsystem, encapsulating the interactions and dependencies between its components. This allows clients to interact with the subsystem through a unified interface, reducing coupling and making the code easier to understand and maintain.

## When to Use the Facade Pattern

Consider using the Facade Pattern in the following situations:

- When you need to simplify a complex subsystem or library by providing a higher-level interface.
- When you want to encapsulate the interactions and dependencies between multiple classes and interfaces.
- When you want to provide a simpler interface to a set of interfaces.

## Structure of the Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Facade**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
2. **Subsystem Classes**: Represents the classes and interfaces that make up the subsystem.

## Example Code üßë‚Äçüíª

This repository provides example implementations of the Facade Pattern in various programming languages, including:

- [Python](./python-example.py)

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with it.
