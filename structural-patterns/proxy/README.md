# Proxy Pattern üîí

Welcome to the Proxy section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Proxy design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Proxy Pattern? ü§î

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the real object, allowing for additional functionality to be provided, such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, or monitoring. This pattern is useful when you need to control access to an object or add additional behavior without modifying its code.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often scenarios where you need to control access to an object or add additional behavior to it. However, modifying the object directly may not be feasible or desirable, especially if it is part of a third-party library or framework. Additionally, modifying the object's code may introduce unwanted side effects or violate the open/closed principle.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Proxy Pattern solves this problem by providing a surrogate or placeholder for the real object. It mimics the interface of the real object and forwards requests to it, allowing for additional functionality to be added before or after forwarding the request. This allows for transparent access control, lazy initialization, logging, or monitoring without modifying the real object's code.

## When to Use the Proxy Pattern

Consider using the Proxy Pattern in the following situations:

- When you need to control access to an object or add additional behavior to it without modifying its code.
- When you want to defer the creation or initialization of an object until it is actually needed (lazy initialization).
- When you want to log, monitor, or restrict access to an object transparently.

## Structure of the Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **ServiceInterface**: Defines the common interface for both the Service and Proxy classes.
2. **Service**: Represents the real object that the Proxy represents and controls access to.
3. **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for the Service, mimicking its interface and controlling access to it.

## Example Code üßë‚Äçüíª

This repository provides example implementations of the Proxy Pattern in various programming languages, including:

- [Python](./python-example.py)

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with it.
