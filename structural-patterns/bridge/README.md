# Bridge Pattern üåâ

Welcome to the Bridge section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Bridge design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Bridge Pattern? ü§î

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. This pattern is useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, or when changes in one do not affect the other.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often scenarios where you have multiple hierarchies or dimensions of variation that need to be combined in various ways. For example, you may have different types of shapes (abstraction) that can be drawn using different rendering techniques (implementation). However, directly tying specific shapes to specific rendering techniques can lead to a complex and rigid system that is difficult to maintain and extend.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Bridge Pattern solves this problem by separating the abstraction (e.g., shapes) from its implementation (e.g., rendering techniques) using composition rather than inheritance. It involves defining separate hierarchies for each dimension of variation and providing a bridge between them to allow for flexible combinations. This allows changes in one hierarchy to be independent of changes in the other, promoting flexibility and ease of maintenance.

## When to Use the Bridge Pattern

Consider using the Bridge Pattern in the following situations:

- When you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.
- When changes in the abstraction or implementation should not affect each other.
- When you have multiple hierarchies or dimensions of variation that need to be combined in various ways.

## Structure of the Bridge Pattern

The Bridge Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Abstraction**: Defines the abstraction's interface and maintains a reference to an object of type Implementor.
2. **Refined Abstraction**: Extends the abstraction defined by Abstraction.
3. **Implementor**: Defines the interface for implementation classes.
4. **Concrete Implementor**: Implements the Implementor interface.

## Example Code üßë‚Äçüíª

This repository provides example implementations of the Bridge Pattern in various programming languages, including:

- [Python](./python-example.py)
