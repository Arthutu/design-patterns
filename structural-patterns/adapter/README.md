# Adapter Pattern üîÑ

Welcome to the Adapter section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Adapter design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Adapter Pattern? ü§î

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, converting the interface of one class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern enables objects to work together that otherwise wouldn't be able to due to incompatible interfaces.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often situations where existing classes or components have interfaces that are incompatible with the interfaces required by clients or other components. This incompatibility prevents these objects from collaborating effectively, leading to code duplication or complex workarounds to make them compatible.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Adapter Pattern solves this problem by creating a wrapper or adapter class that implements the interface required by the client and delegates the calls to the interface of the adaptee (the incompatible class). This allows the client to interact with the adapter using its expected interface, while the adapter handles the translation or mapping of method calls to the adaptee's interface.

## When to Use the Adapter Pattern

Consider using the Adapter Pattern in the following situations:

- When you need to integrate existing classes or components with incompatible interfaces into your application.
- When you want to reuse existing classes or components without modifying their source code.
- When you need to provide a consistent interface to clients for interacting with multiple classes or components with different interfaces.

## Structure of the Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Target**: Defines the interface that the client expects.
2. **Adapter**: Implements the Target interface and maintains a reference to an instance of the Adaptee class.
3. **Adaptee**: Defines the interface that needs to be adapted.
4. **Client**: Collaborates with objects through the Target interface.

## Example Code üßë‚Äçüíª

This repository provides example implementations of the Adapter Pattern in various programming languages, including:

- [Python](./python-example.py)

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with it.
