# Composite Pattern üå≥

Welcome to the Composite section of the Design Patterns repository! This directory contains an explanation of the Composite design pattern along with a code example in Python.

## What is the Composite Pattern? ü§î

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is useful when you need to represent objects in a hierarchical structure and perform operations on them recursively.

### 1. Problem ‚ùå

In a software application, there are often scenarios where you need to work with objects in a tree-like structure, such as representing the components of a graphical user interface, the elements of a document, or the parts of a composite product. However, treating individual objects and compositions of objects differently can lead to complex and error-prone code.

### 2. Solution ‚úÖ

The Composite Pattern solves this problem by defining a common interface for both individual objects (leaves) and compositions of objects (branches). It allows clients to treat both types of objects uniformly, enabling operations to be performed recursively on the entire tree structure. This promotes code reuse, simplifies client code, and provides flexibility in managing complex hierarchies.

## When to Use the Composite Pattern

Consider using the Composite Pattern in the following situations:

- When you need to represent objects in a hierarchical structure and perform operations on them recursively.
- When you want clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- When you need to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

## Structure of the Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern typically consists of the following components:

1. **Component**: Declares the interface for objects in the composition and implements default behavior for leaf objects.
2. **Leaf**: Represents individual objects in the composition that have no children.
3. **Composite**: Represents compositions of objects, including methods for adding, removing, and accessing child components.
4. **Client**: Manipulates objects in the composition through the Component interface.
