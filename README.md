# Design Patterns

üëã Welcome to the Design Patterns repository! This repository contains explanations and examples of common software design patterns. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding design patterns can greatly enhance your ability to design robust and maintainable software systems.

## What are Design Patterns? ü§î

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced software engineers. Design patterns provide a standardized way to solve recurring design problems, making them easier to understand, communicate, and implement.

## Types of Design Patterns üí¨

This repository covers three main categories of design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns**: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.

2. **Structural Patterns**: Structural patterns focus on the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures. Examples include Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction between objects and the delegation of responsibilities among them. Examples include Observer, Strategy, Command, Template Method, Iterator, State, Visitor, and Mediator.

## Repository Structure üóÇÔ∏è

- Each design pattern has its own directory containing a markdown file with an explanation of the pattern.
- Additionally, each directory contains code examples in ~~various programming languages~~ python to illustrate the implementation of the pattern.

## How to Use This Repository ü§ì

1. Browse through the directories to find the design pattern you're interested in.
2. Read the markdown file to understand the concept and usage of the pattern.
3. Explore the accompanying code example to see the pattern in action.
4. Experiment with the code example, modify it, and integrate it into your own projects.
